# Project: Recursion
This is a TOP (The Odin Project) task on CS (Computer Science) basics, especifically Recursion.

## Content
This repository contains two folders:
```bash
fibs_rec
merge_sort
```

The `fibs_rec` folder contains a fibbonacci function that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of `8`, this function should return the array `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]`.

The `merge_sort` folder contains a function that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
